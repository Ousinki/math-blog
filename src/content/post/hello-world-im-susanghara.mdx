December 17: An important update for readers in the United States.

You deserve an explanation, so please don't skip this 1-minute read. It's Wednesday, December 17. Our fundraiser will soon be over, but we're short of our goal. If you've lost count of how many times you've visited Wikipedia this year, we hope that means it's given you at least $2.75 of knowledge. If everyone who finds Wikipedia useful gave $2.75, we'd hit our goal in a few hours.

It's been 25 years and Wikipedia is still free. It's still created by people, not machines, and we don't run ads or put up paywalls because we're not here to make a profit off your attention. In other words, it's still the internet we were promised.

Whether you remember the early days of Wikipedia or you've grown up in a world with information at your fingertips, if Wikipedia provides you with $2.75 worth of knowledge, donate today. If you are undecided, remember any contribution helps.
